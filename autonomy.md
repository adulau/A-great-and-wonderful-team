# Autonomy

When comparing with other similar teams, a significant difference emerges which is the autonomy of team members.
Even if the group is very tight together, a counter force exists which allows people to drive their own projects.
This balance is key to keep a creative and challenging environment where each employee can sparkle new ideas
or concepts.

Within a team, autonomy can be seen as a disruptive factor but it's also a positive way to drive other team members
to provide feedback and become autonomous too.

The autonomy comes with an additional challenge for some people but especially organisations: *responsibility*
which can be the most complex aspect to deal within an organisation. The challenge lies in how a staff is perceived.
The employee is no more a simple element of an organisation which is waiting for orders from a hierarchy. He or she
becomes an element that can change, drive or even break how an organisation is conducted.

Within our organisation, there is this constant "fight" to rethink or change the driving forces in the organisation,
the team and position of each others. We think this is part of the organisation and the system. If there is not a
constant stream discussions, critics or improvements, an organisation can be considered in a dying state.

Some guests who visited us where surprised in the day-to-day discussions where some staff can be very critics. As
there is no latent discussions about a broken model or project, critical thinking is done as early as possible and provide
a ground for proposing improvements or updates. The main idea behind the critical approach used within our team is
always to come with proposals which are realistic enough and can be put in practice by the one(s) proposing or together as a group.
