Building an incredibly successful team with a flat organisational structure is not coming from nowhere.
In our team, the background of the members is very disparate. The management experience has sometimes been enlightening but often also a painful or disturbing experience for the vast majority of our team members.

Creating a model of well-being and success in an organisation lies in a successive layer of evolution with
a strong feedback-loop. One of the most common models that we were used to was that of the free software community.
An open source community is built on different social rules but the most common is "release early, release often".
Having early feedback on a practical experiment is often the most meaningful input, something that is nearly impossible
to get in a committee-review approach.

Some team members were used to hackerspaces and were especially close to the principles behind the hacker ethic[^1].
