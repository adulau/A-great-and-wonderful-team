Building an incredible successful team with a flat organizational structure is not coming from nowhere.
In our team, the background of the members is very disparate. The management experience has been sometime
an enlightenment but often it was a painful or disturbing experience for the vast majority of our team members.

Creating a model of well-being and success in an organization lies into a successive layer of evolution with
a strong feedback-loop. One of the most common model that we were used to was the free software community.
An open source community is built on different social rules but the most common is "release early, release often".
Having early feedbacks on a practical experiment is often the most meaningful input that is nearly impossible
to get in a committee-review approach.

Some team members were used to hackerspaces and especially close to the principles behind the hacker ethic[^1].
