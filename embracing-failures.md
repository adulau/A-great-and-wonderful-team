# Embracing failures

While doing a discussion with another team in the incident response field, they asked us what is working great
in our team and what is a success. But we cannot easily find the great magical things which work for us as a team.
We did list to them a large number of failures or even embarrassing stories that didn't work out for us.

Out of this discussion, we can safely said that the most successful approach is to **embrace failures**.

We didn't want to theorize everything we do. But this embracing failures seem to be in-line like the [fail-fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast)
system design or even the various startups *fail better* strategies.

> All of old. Nothing else ever. Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.
